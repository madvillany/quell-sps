					Robert R. (Bob) Bode is a performance-driven, multi-disciplined, veteran real estate professional who has built a track record reflecting accomplishment in a full spectrum of real estate assets, functions, platforms and transactions. Bob began his career as an “on-the-ground” multi-family residential property manager in 1974 and developed a diverse skillset consisting  of property and asset management; property/portfolio underwriting and monitoring; project entitlement and development, construction budget “value engineering” and construction oversight; property leasing, operations and sales. He is a seasoned manger who balances property-level experience with a strategic vision. 
Bob’s core competency centers on innovative “financial engineering”, transaction structure, and capital markets execution. His expertise encompasses direct lending, merchant banking and equity financing; he has assembled an extensive network of institutional and private investors. Bob has also served in an advisory capacity for institutional investors and lenders (including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a global insurance consortium) performing property and loan underwriting/re-underwriting, CRE portfolio surveillance, and forensic accounting/analytics throughout his 40-year career. Bob has personally originated, underwritten and or closed approximately $2 billion in transaction or portfolio debt and equity, including fixed and floating rate debt, whole loan syndications and structured loans (construction, bridge, permanent), “B pieces”, mezzanine, preferred equity, and pari passu equity.   
As a member of the Washington Square Realty Capital team, Bob will be tasked to help grow the firm’s national origination business, expand the Washington Square transaction pipeline, introduce new capital markets relationships, and interface with the team to structure full-service financing solutions for present and future clients. </p>

<p>
Before joining Washington Square, Bob was Chief Operating Officer/Risk Manager of BatteryMarch Capital, LLC, a middle-markets, non-recourse, floating rate bridge lender for transitional asset re-position and “value add” CRE properties (office/MOB, retail, hospitality and multifamily) located in primary and secondary U.S. markets. BatteryMarch Capital co-branded the platform with Garrison Investment Management, a New York private equity firm with $6 billion AUM. In 2015, Bob originated, underwrote and closed for BatteryMarch $45,000,000 of small-balance CRE loans on retail, hospitality and medical office properties. From 2011-2013, Bob was a Managing Director of Capital Markets for CW Capital/Rockwood Real Estate Advisors in New York. Both firms were owned by Fortress Investment Group ($70 billion AUM investment manager and trading vehicle). CW is one of the three largest Special Servicers in the CMBS industry. Bob’s principal role was to manage relationships with 30+ institutional investors/lenders (private equity funds; real estate managers with limited partner capital; Sovereign Wealth Funds; public REITS and money-center banks). In addition, Bob arranged REO and non-performing loan sales for CW while placing debt and joint venture equity for Rockwood. Auction.Com, an online residential and commercial real estate marketplace, purchased Rockwood in 2013 and collapsed the traditional investment sales and capital markets brokerage businesses. </p>
<p>
As an executive of an entrepreneurial CRE investment firm, ZAC Management Group, LLC, from 1998-2011, Bob was responsible for transaction origination, project finance, due diligence, asset management and operational oversight. Historically, ZAC Management partnered with institutional-caliber real estate developers and operators to acquire or develop high-quality CRE assets and portfolios. Bob in tandem with the other principals, executives and affiliates of ZAC have originated, structured and closed over $4 billion in CRE transactions since 2001. Among his capital markets assignments, Bob coordinated placement of construction and permanent debt financing for luxury hotel and resort properties including the $250 million Ft. Lauderdale (Florida) W Hotel/Residences and the $300 million Deer Valley (Utah) St. Regis Resort. Bob also structured and managed equity investments in private residence club and multifamily joint ventures for ZAC. Since resigning his executive post at ZAC to join CW Capital/Rockwood Real Estate Advisors in 2011, Bob has been retained by ZAC as a consultant to asset manage a legacy portfolio of CRE assets for the company’s affiliated partnerships.

				Leveraging his experience in the development/re-development and operations of golf-driven master planned communities, Bob was Project Manager of Oak Tree Country Club from 1994-1998. Oak Tree is a 1,500-acre master planned, gated golf community located in suburban Oklahoma City that was purchased from the RTC in 1994 by an affiliate of the Yale University Endowment. As Chief Due Diligence Officer for a Hong Kong-based master planned community developer, Bob directed a team in the origination and underwriting of potential equity investments in more than 40 distressed RTC/bank REO golf resorts and planned residential communities. He also managed a $200 million real estate equity syndication and asset management program for a regional investment bank in Philadelphia. Bob has structured, capitalized, managed and/or advised on the acquisition, disposition and/or development of 4,000 multi-family rental units, large-scale mixed-use and master planned residential communities; hospitality/resort, and commercial/retail transactions with institutional and private investors. He has played significant roles in 25 CRE development and re-development projects (across all asset classes). 
Bob holds an M.B.A. from the University of Cincinnati, served as an Officer in the United States Army, is a member of the Urban Land Institute and the Nether Providence (suburban Philadelphia) Planning Commission. He has been a Pennsylvania licensed commercial REALTOR since 2008.
